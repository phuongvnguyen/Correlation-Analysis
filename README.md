# Correlation-Analysis
Correlation is one of the most popular methods to detect the linear relation between two features. One might have difficulty to find a strong correlation because of high data dimensionality. To this end, I developed a program, namely: Pcorrelation. Several vital outcomes are produced by using this program, such as

1. Seek a number of attributes that have a correlation of over specific threshold.

2. List names of attributes that have a correlation of over specific threshold.

3. Show pair of attributes that have a correlation of over specific threshold.

4. Visualize the correlation matrix
